'carrot' is a my first attempt at a search engine. It's pretty bad but looks quite nice. The implementation is really chaotic because I just hacked it together in a day.

### future

* at some point I'll use data structures to speed up search. The current method is linear.
* there's no NLP in use - queries like "how do I..." aren't interpreted my the engine.
* you can use regular expressions to search more precisely.
* I'd like to add relevence ranking, e.g. PageRank.
